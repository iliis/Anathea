Anathea is a small graphics engine, mainly for GUI-stuff, but intented
to be useful for games in general. It uses SDL and renders things with
OpenGL. So far, it has a layout-system, that is based on a CAD-like constraints system.

Anathea is already usable but missing a lot of things to be truly useful.
Expect more to come (Animations and Sound are the two Next Big Things, after
the GUI-part is finished).
